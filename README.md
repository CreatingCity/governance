# Community Governance

This is the home of the Creating.City portal. The main goal of this community of researchers is to discuss, develop and research technological challenges current faced by modern cities.
In addition, it is also focussed on promoting scientific discussions through forums, symposiums, workshops, conferences and academic/scientific material (scientific papers, books, reports, among others).

Creating.City is a group idealized by researchers, professors and friends, which study and discuss ideas in a health, peaceful and sustainable environment.
It was formely created around the recent concepts of Smart and Digital Cities.
